## שקלא וטריא

### משנה

1. What happens if a woman without a fixed נדה cycle touch תרומה and then later notice דם
	1. Beis Shammai said that they are only טמא from when they notice the דם and on.
	2. Beis Hillel: We assume that anything she touched since the last time she checked is טמא מספק
	3. The חכמים: If the last time she checked was more than a day prior, only things in the last day since seeing דם are טמא, and if the last time she checked was less than 24 hours ago, then anything she touched is טהור. 
2. A woman with a fixed cycle is only טמא from when she sees דם and on.
	+ This is even if she touched תרומה and immediately afterwards sees דם.
	+ This is even according to the חכמים who say that if she does not have a fixed cycle, things from the last day are טמא.
3. One who is משמשת בעדים counts as an examination to reduce the time of when things are טמא

### גמרא

1. Why does שמאי say what she touched is טמא? Because the woman has a חזקה of being טהור from before, so we assume she was טהור at the time she touched the תרומה.
2. What about הלל? He says since דם comes regularly, she does not have a חזקה.
3. Q: But we say in the משנה in מקואות ב:ב that a מקוה that was known to have 40 סאה and is later measured and later is found to have only 39, things that were טובל in between are טמא, whether the מקוה is in a רשות הרבים, or a רשות היחיד.
	1. According to שמאי, why are they טמא at all?
	2. According to הלל, why are they ודאי and not ספק?
4. A: By מקוה, we can say טמא item has a חזקה of being טמא.
	+ Q: אדרבה, the מקוה has a חזקה of being good!
	+ A: NO! the מקוה is חסר in front of you!
		+ Q: So too, there is דם in front of you!
		+ A: By the נדה, we can say the דם only came now.
			+ Q: By the מקוה, we can also say that.
			+ A: No, מקוה only drips out a little at a time
				+ Q: But maybe the דם also only comes a little at a time?
	+ A2: By מקוה, there are 2 חזקות saying it is טמא, that the כלי is טמא, and that the מקוה is חסר in front of you. By נדה, there is only 1, that she sees דם now.
