## Proposal

The גרנ"ט explains that there are 2 types of תנאי, a תנאי קיום, where you have to be מקיים the תנאי in order for the מעשה to happen, and aתנאי בטול, where you have to be מבטל the תנאי for the מעשה to be בטל. 
## Source

1. The רמב"ם (גירושין  ח:כב) says that if one if one give his wife a גט on condition she gives him 200 זוז and he does not specify a time, and dies before she pays, the גט is not good because she did not give the money, and it is not בטל because he did not specify a time, a nd therefore she can't get married, and she can't do יבום, and she need חליצה.
2. Q: The מגיד משנה asks: Why can't she get do יבום, It is imbosible for her to give the money, so it should be בטל?
3. A: He answers that the רמב"ם in פרק ט says that if one give his wife a גט on condition he does not come back for a year, and dies within the year, even though he does can't come back, she can't get married if their is a יבם until after the year. We see that even though the תנאי can't be נתקיים, it is not בטל.
4. Q: גרנ"ט: That is a סתירה, not an answer, by the case of the money, the מעשה of giving the money is what makes it a גט, so without giving it it is not a גט, meaning we need you to be מבטל the מעשה to be מבטל the תנאי. By the case of אם לא באתי, the action of not coming is what makes it a גט, so we are saying that you need to be מקיים the תנאי to make the מעשה happen?
5. The גרנ"ט explains that there are 2 types of תנאי:
	1. A תנאי קיום, where you have to be מקיים the תנאי in order for the מעשה to happen. Here if the תנאי is neither בטול nor נתקיים it would the מעשה would be בטול.
	2. A תנאי בטול, where you have to be מבטל the תנאי for the מעשה to be בטל. Here if the תנאי is neither בטל nor נתקיים the מעשה would be קיים.
6. By the case of the money, he is trying to tease her so the תנאי is on the תנאי ביטול. By the case of אם לא באתי, his goal is that it should not be a גט if he returns, so it is a תנאי קיום.
## Challenges

1. Q: חזון איש: But by תנאי בטל מעשה קיים don't we see that every תנאי is a תנאי ביטול?
